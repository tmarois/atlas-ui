# Atlas UI

Atlas UI is a Vue 3 component library built with **PrimeVue 4** and **Tailwind CSS 4**. It provides reusable building blocks so teams can ship dashboards quickly in any Vue 3 application.

For backend helpers like server-driven datatable options, see the companion [Atlas Laravel](https://github.com/tmarois/atlas-laravel) package.
