# Atlas UI

Atlas UI is a Vue 3 component library built with **PrimeVue 4** and **Tailwind CSS 4**. It provides reusable building blocks so teams can ship dashboards quickly in any Vue 3 application.

For backend helpers like server-driven datatable options, see the companion [Atlas Laravel](https://github.com/tmarois/atlas-laravel) package.

## Installation

- Install the package: `npm install @tmarois/atlas-ui`
- Import the CSS in your app entry (e.g., `main.ts` or `main.js`):

  ```ts
  // main.ts
  import { createApp } from 'vue'
  import App from './App.vue'
  import '@tmarois/atlas-ui/style.css'

  createApp(App).mount('#app')
  ```
